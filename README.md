Especially to use appropriate, modified, graphics to visualize math concept such as : 
integral calculation, descriptive statistics, and many other cases. In this version, the application is limited only for :
1. Visualize and working on simple integral calculations (linear and quadratic functions)
2. Visualize and working on basic statistics measurement (arithmetic-mean)

Modules : `integral_1D` and `basic_statistics`

**How to Start:**

`import math_ed.integral_1D as integral`
`import math_ed.basic_statistics as bstat`

The name `integral` and `bstat` are optional, you can set `as x` or `as y` or `as anyname`.
